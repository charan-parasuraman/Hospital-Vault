# Hospital-Vault

In this project the main aim was to build a Graphical user interface (GUI) and connect to a database.
With this an ER-diagram was built around doctor and a patient with an individual login page and
connect to a database using Sqlite and Java. Through the relational schema and the tables created in
the database the program can run multiple queries using try-catch block. This enables a smooth flow
of the hospital vault in which a patient can input their symptoms and select a particular specialist and
book an appointment. This then reflected in the doctorâ€™s page where the doctors can give corrected
feedback and the prescription to the respected patient after the checkup and also book a follow-up
appointment.
